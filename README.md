# Mutation-Testing-Demo
Example demo of using the Stryker mutation testing library in a node.js project with jest running the unit tests!

## Why It's Awesome
The word ___"mutation‚Äù___ in mutation testing is referring to a script that goes through each line of your source code and temporarily changes (ie. mutates) it in some way. Then the unit tests are run against each of these ‚Äúmutant codebases‚Äù. We developers can then view the mutation testing output to become aware of the mutant cases where all tests still pass, and this pinpoints for us exact places in the code that we can add missing assertions for in our tests! üí°
